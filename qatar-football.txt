Tickets for the Qatar 2022 World Cup have been put on sale with prices for residents wanting to attend the games starting at 40 Qatari riyals ($11), the cheapest for locals since the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.

Neither FIFA nor the local organising committee has announced how many fans will be allowed into stadiums for the first World Cup in an Arab country, which runs from November 21 until December 18.
